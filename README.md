# Regression

The goal is to build a good regression model of the price of an automobile as a function of many of its attributes (ie, predictors), e.g., weight, number of doors, engine location, etc. The data set comes from the UCI dataset archive, and is available from this page:

## Specifically, the goal is to:

### 1a. Build a model of automobile price in terms of as many predictors as you need. Don't include any categorical variables. Make sure the model is:
* the best one you can get (based on adjusted R^2),
* it has no significant multicolinearity,
* is not overfitted, and
* it passes the regression diagnostics.

#### What to report: the model summary, the R^2, and the adjusted R^2 of your best model.

### 1b. Your model from 1a. uses a number of predictors. In this part we care about the top 3 most important predictors, in terms of the variance explained, that are significant (in terms of the p-value).

#### What to report:  the top-3 predictors in your model, and the percentage variance explained by each.

### 1c. Interpret the model for each of those top-3 predictors, in words.

#### What to report:  For each of the top-3 predictors in your model, write one sentence into a text cell, interpreting its effect.

## 2. Here, build a new model including all predictors you used before, and include categorical variables. Make sure the model is:
* the best one you can get (based on adjusted R^2), 
* it has no significant multicolinearity,
* is not overfitted, and
* it passes the regression diagnostics.

#### What to report:  The model summary, R^2, and adjusted R^2 of your best model.

## 3. Can you find a better model (i.e., one with higher adjusted R^2) using polynomial regression? Make sure the model is:
* the best one you can get (based on adjusted R^2), 
* it has no significant multicolinearity,
* is not overfitted, and
* it passes the regression diagnostics.

#### What to report: The model summary, R^2, and adjusted R^2 of your best model.
